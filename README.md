# Project Overview

**F1 Champions App**

[DEMO FRONTEND](https://awake-mindfulness-production.up.railway.app/)
[DEMO SERVER](https://f1-fullstack-production.up.railway.app/api/seasons)

![F1 Poster](/assets/reference.jpeg "Reference")

A fullstack web application that displays a list of Formula 1 world champions from 2005 to the present. Selecting a champion reveals the winners of each race from that year.

The app is intended for Formula 1 fans, data enthusiasts, and developers interested in sports-based fullstack applications.
The design draws inspiration from retro F1 posters to give a nostalgic, race-day feel.

## Features

**World Champion List**: View all Formula 1 world champions from 2005 to the latest season.

**Race Winners by Year**: Click on a champion to explore the individual race winners for that season.

**High Performance with Redis**: Uses Redis to cache champion and race data for fast response times.

**Automated Data Refresh**: A scheduled background job (via Bull) fetches new data weekly from the Ergast API.

**Client-Side Caching**: Uses localStorage on the frontend to avoid redundant API calls and improve UX.

**Modern Fullstack Stack**: Built with Node.js, PostgreSQL, React, Typescript, and Docker ‚Äî all wired together with CI/CD.

**Deployed to the Cloud**: Hosted on Railway

## Setup & Installation

**Prerequisites**

- Docker
- Make

**Clone the Project**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sadaskeanu/f1-fullstack.git
cd f1-fullstack
```

**Setup Environment Variables**

Copy .env.example files for the root, backend, and frontend using:

```bash
make setup-env
```

his will create:

.env

server/.env

client/.env

üöÄ **Start the App**

Spin up all containers with build:

```bash
make up
```

To stop everything:

```bash
make down
```

Other useful commands:

- make restart: Rebuild and restart containers

- make logs: Follow container logs

- make prune: Clean up all unused Docker resources

- make build: Build Docker images

üß™ **Run Tests**

Server tests:

```bash
make test-server
```

Client tests:

```bash
make test-client
```

## Architecture

The F1 Fullstack app follows a modular fullstack architecture with clear separation of concerns:

üì¶ **Structure**

client/: React frontend with TypeScript and CSS Modules

server/: Node.js backend with Express, Prisma, and TypeScript

docker-compose.yml: Defines all services for local development (frontend, backend, Redis, PostgreSQL, pgAdmin)

üß† **Backend Services**

REST API built with Express

Data layer powered by Prisma + PostgreSQL

External data fetched from Ergast API

Redis used to cache:

World champion list

Race winners per season

Bull queue handles background jobs

A scheduled job runs weekly to refresh champion and race data

bull-board provides a web dashboard for job monitoring

üß™ **API Documentation & Validation**

OpenAPI/Swagger documents the available routes

Zod used to validate incoming data

Helmet secures HTTP headers

üéØ **Frontend Logic**

Built with React + TypeScript

Uses Fetch API and Axios for API requests

Manages state via useState hooks

Caches API responses with localStorage

Tested with Vitest and React Testing Library

üöÄ **CI/CD & Deployment**

The app uses **GitHub Actions** for a complete CI/CD pipeline, triggered on:

- Push or pull request to the `main` branch

üß± **Pipeline Stages**

1. **Install**

   - Installs dependencies for both `server/` and `client/` using `npm ci`

2. **Lint**

   - Lints the backend and frontend codebases

3. **Test**

   - Backend tests run with a PostgreSQL container
   - Frontend tests use Vitest and React Testing Library

4. **Security**

   - **CodeQL** analysis for static code vulnerabilities in JavaScript/TypeScript and GitHub Actions
   - **Snyk** scans for known vulnerabilities in both frontend and backend dependencies (`--severity-threshold=high`)

5. **Docker**

   - Builds and pushes Docker images to Docker Hub:
     - `${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}/f1-backend:latest`
     - `${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}/f1-frontend:latest`

6. **Vulnerability Scanning**

   - **Trivy** scans Docker images for `HIGH` and `CRITICAL` severity issues

7. **Deployment**
   - Automatic deployment to **Railway** using Railway CLI
   - Triggered only on the `main` branch
   - Uses the following GitHub secrets:
     - `RAILWAY_PROJECT_ID`
     - `RAILWAY_TOKEN`
     - `RAILWAY_SERVER_SERVICE_ID`
     - `RAILWAY_CLIENT_SERVICE_ID`
